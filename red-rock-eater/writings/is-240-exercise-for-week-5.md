IS 240 -- Information Systems Analysis and Design

Assignment for week 5: Layering

Modularity is a fundamental concept of system design. The most important
modules are so-called "platforms": hardware or software standards that a
wide range of other services can be built on top of. (The term "platform"
is often restricted to hardware, such as the Palm Pilot, but we are using
the term in a broad sense.) Examples of platforms include the Internet, the
IBM PC, the cellular telephone (actually several different cellular telephone
architectures), Java (and its execution environment), and XML (and its
associated software tools). By providing a clearly defined functionality that
the world already wants for other reasons, platforms make it much easier to
develop new information services.

Perhaps the most important kind of platform is a network service "layer".
Messerschmitt explains the concept of a layer at some length, but here
is a simple version. Networked services are complex, and so to manage that
complexity they are organized in layers. Each layer provides a distinct and
well-defined service. In particular, each layer defines a clear contract
that governs its interactions with the service layers upon which it is
built, and the service layers that are built upon it in turn. An example
of a service layer is IP, the Internet Protocol, which is a protocol for
moving packets of information ("datagrams") from point A to point B across
a range of interconnected networks. IP is a "middleware" layer, meaning
that it presupposes the existence of lower layers (the individual subnetworks,
which move bits from one machine to another within a network) and is itself
presupposed by higher layers (such as TCP, which controls the flow of packets
through IP). Another example of a service layer is SSL, the Secure Sockets
Layer for the secure transmission of sensitive information between clients
and servers on the Web. SSL is built on top of TCP and IP, and other, more
complex service can be built on top of SSL in turn. All modern networked
services are organized in layers.

The design of service layers is not only technically complicated; it is also
socially complicated. The whole point of a service layer is support a wide
range of applications, and so the designer must learn precisely what services
the potential applications need and then reconcile all of these potentially
conflicting needs in the design. This can be hard. The applications may
not have been imagined yet, the applications designers may work in different
disciplines and may therefore not speak the same language, and the needs
of the various applications may change over time. A good service layer is
parsimonious: it is cleanly and simply defined, and represents a powerful
and easily understood abstraction. An overly complex service layer invites
trouble, and should be broken into more natural parts or rethought from
scratch. Yet the boundaries between service layers are not always easy
to define. The best way to design the boundary between TCP and IP, for
example, was not at all obvious at first. IP, for example, is a so-called
"best-effort" protocol -- packets submitted to a host or router that
implements IP are not guaranteed to arrive in the correct order, or indeed
at all. This sounds strange, but in retrospect it is a natural consequence
of the demand for parsimony: by making fewer guarantees, IP can remain simple.
TCP, which is built on top of IP, does offer guarantees, and part of its task
is to resend packets that are not acknowledged.

In this assignment, we will explore the process of designing a service
layer that can provide a platform for a wide range of other services. This
is usually an advanced topic, but I want us to begin with it because of the
central importance of networked applications architecture to the future of
computing. Much of what we do in this assignment will make more sense after
we discuss data modeling and other traditional technical subjects. But we
will proceed anyway.

We will proceed as follows: I will sketch the workings of a brand new service
layer that we will call the "Suitcase Layer" (abbreviated SL). A suitcase,
roughly speaking, lets someone take their data with them wherever they go.
(For those who know about such things, SL will be presumably built on top
of a distributed object management layer such as CORBA or COM, assuming that
the world has finally gotten around to adopting an object management standard
by 2010.) By creating the illusion that one's data is always present, just
as one's purse is always on one's shoulder, it makes computing (somewhat)
location-independent and device-independent. Applications and devices that
are SL-compliant allow a person to carry an elaborate computing environment
from place to place. Wherever the person might be, their computing
environment will spontaneously reconstruct itself using whatever devices
happen to be present. Applications developers will rejoice because they can
presuppose that data, application, and device have been brought together.

Let me start with an example. A major problem in restaurants, particularly
someplace like California, is that diners have dietary requirements that
are too complex to negotiate with the waiter. "Does that soup have any
dairy products in it?" Only at the finest restaurants will waiters know
things like this. So let us employ SL to create a menu that automatically
configures itself to suit the requirements of a particular diner. We will
have to start by defining data structures to represent these requirements.
To keep it simple, we will imagine that an authority has defined a vocabulary
of potentially sensitive ingredients, and then we will provide people with
an interface that lets them check off the ingredients that they will not eat.
These might include whole categories such as meat and dairy products that some
people avoid for health reasons, or ingredients that some people are allergic
to (eggs, cilantro), or ingredients that are proscribed by some people's
religions (beef, pork, shellfish). (Observe that the categories are naturally
hierarchical: meat includes beef, which includes veal.) It doesn't matter
where this information is stored; the individual's suitcase will make the
information available whenever it is needed.

To use a suitcase, the would-be diner carries a device that is the size
of a double-thick credit card; this device could be carried in a wallet or
incorporated into some other device. (Swatch has recently announced a similar
device that is incorporated into a watch.) Even though it has no switches,
data ports, display screens, or moving parts, it is constantly active.
It talks to wireless networks, and especially to the spontaneous wireless
networking capabilities of any and every device that supports the Suitcase
protocol. One of these SL-compliant devices is made from electronic paper:
a computer display screen that looks and feels like parchment but includes a
bunch of digital electronics and can change its "pixels" from black to white
and back. Participating restaurants "print" their menus on these devices by
entering the ingredients and descriptions of the dishes into another device
that is capable of exchanging data wirelessly with the menus. The electronic
menus look and feel exactly like traditional paper menus. People who do
not carry suitcases get a menu whose display is perfectly traditional --
the one-size-fits-all menu that most restaurants use now. When the menu
detects the presence of a suitcase, however, it downloads the diner's list
of proscribed ingredients and displays a customized menu. Dishes that cannot
be made without the proscribed ingredients are not displayed; dishes that do
not contain the proscribed ingredients are displayed as usual; and dishes that
usually contain the proscribed ingredients but can be prepared without them
are displayed in a modified form. Waiters carry SL-enabled order pads, just
to make sure that each diner's requirements are transmitted correctly to the
kitchen.

Now, in reading this description you will no doubt observe that nobody would
be foolish to build a system like this on a special-purpose, stand-alone
basis, what Messerschmitt calls a "stovepipe". But that's not what
we're proposing. Imagine a world in which the Suitcase Layer is already
well-established in the market, incorporated in dozens of applications,
and supported by dozens of devices. Many other platforms are also widespread
in this world, including the electronic paper technology. In that world,
the incremental cost of building the dynamic menu application is not
great. An entrepreneur could implement a prototype in an afternoon from
readily available components, and the prototype could be used to raise funds
and sell the concept to restauranteurs. It is not at all clear that the
restauranteurs would buy the concept, of course. They would have to contend
with more special orders in their kitchens, and they would have to represent
their dishes in a structured data format such an XML document type. They
might regard this as a hassle and a risk to their trade secrets, or they might
regard it as a competitive necessity. We would have to see.

In any case, our job in this assignment is to work out some of the details
of SL. Each team should, independently of the others, choose a community
of practice, sketch out some SL-enabled services that the people in that
community might find useful, pitch the concepts to some members of the
community, iterate their designs a few times, pick the most promising one,
and work out some of the details. Having done so, prepare a seven-minute
presentation that tells about the community, explains the service concept,
tells us something you've learned about how the service would fit into the
life of the community, and (most importantly) specifies in as much detail as
you can the demands that your service will make on the design of SL.

Let me explain these concepts in a little more detail. First, communities
of practice. Systems analysis and design have historically been focused
on geographically localized workplaces; their "users" have either been
individuals or small numbers of workers operating within a rigid division of
labor. That is the industrial automation paradigm, and it is an anachronism.
Another approach is to design for communities of practice. A community of
practice might be defined as those people who share some important thing in
common. All of the world's truck drivers form a community of practice. So do
all of the world's moms, all of the world's stamp collectors, and everyone in
the world who uses the Apple Macintosh. The important thing about communities
of practice is that they think together. They may not have an elaborate
sense of collective identity -- an organization, a flag, a concept of "us" and
"them" -- but they will always have institutions (formal or informal) through
which they compare notes, spread news, and accumulate a collective memory.
That is what Internet discussion groups are for; it is also what professional
associations are for, and quilting bees, and after-work beer-drinking
sessions. To design for a community of practice means to be aware of, and
try to support and amplify, the community's ways: its work practices, forms
of association, genres of communication, and so on. One no longer designs
for "stamp collectors" as individuals; rather, one designs for "the stamp
collectors' community". The distinction is subtle, and in some cases we admit
that it has no important consequences. But it is often terribly important,
especially when our design processes implicitly set out to prevent, substitute
for, or suppress the mechanisms by which a community of practice thinks
together.

You'll start by choosing a community of practice to work with. Your best
choice is a community that a member of your team is located on the edge
of. If you are a stamp collector, in other words, don't try to design for
the community of stamp collectors. You are too close to them. But if your
spouse is a stamp collector, then that's ideal. You will have access to the
community, but you will have the intellectual distance that you will need
to be analytical about it. Alternatively, you can choose a community that a
team member belongs to, but then make a big point of distinguishing between
the community member's perspective and everyone else's. In any case, you
should probably choose a community of practice whose members move around, and
who generally might find suitcases useful.

We want you to design iteratively. You won't have time to really learn about
the community, or really design in a participatory way, or to iterate more
than few times, but at least you'll get a rough sense. Start with basic
knowledge about the community. Then come up with a few concepts. These
concepts should be very simple, back-of-the-envelope one-liners. Pitch the
concepts to a few members of the community and listen really hard to what
they say. Would they find it useful? Most likely you'll discover that you
were clueless about the community, or that you lacked important knowledge
about its workings. That's good, because now you'll be shorn of some
preconceptions. Rework your concepts or invent new ones. Bring them back
to your community members, and sketch them in a little more detail this time.
You might scribble a picture or a diagram. Listen again. Back and forth:
designing, pitching, and listening. That is the iterative cycle. Go through
it a few times -- not enough to really implement your prospective service,
just enough to get a solid sense of it.

At some point you will pick the most promising of your candidates, and you
will work it out some more. In particular, you will ask what demands it
will make of the Suitcase Layer. What kinds of information about the person
will have to be carried around? What kinds of devices need to be able to
support the protocols, and which kinds of applications? Do multiple people's
suitcases need to be able to communicate with one another? Does the suitcase
need to support access to huge databases and gigantic information services?
Do you need audio? Video? Large, complex documents in different formats?
What kinds of information will need to have structure imposed on it (like
the menus and ingredients in the example above)? We recognize that you will
not be able to answer all of these questions precisely at this point in the
course. That's okay. Do what you can.

Documentation and diagrams will be important. In seven minutes you will be
communicating a lot of information, and so you should work hard to define
your design concept in a concise and compelling way. Draw pictures of what it
might look like. Build a model out of cardboard. Install props at the front
of the room to show how it might work. The hardest part to explain might be
the demands you'll be making on the design of SL. We can help with this.

We want the five groups to work independently. Once we come together and
hear all of the group presentations, we will listen hard to the requirements
that everyone is imposing on SL. These requirements will no doubt be hard
to reconcile. They may conflict; they may pull the layer's design in five
incompatible directions; they may be expressed in different vocabularies
that are hard to translate into a single language. Some teams will probably
mention issues that other teams will not. Some teams will probably go into
more detail than others, or interpret what we mean by "requirements" in
different ways. All of this is normal, and our point is exactly to teach what
it is like to confront the incommensurable demands that different applications
can place on an incipient platform.

Remember that we are designing ten years in the future. Please go ahead
and presuppose the technologies of ten years from now: processors that are
100 times faster than we have now; platforms such as spontaneous wireless
networking that are widely implemented; giant databases; small batteries;
and so on. This will be clearer after the presentations for week 4.

Remember, too, the long-term agenda for the class projects: we are using
design to investigate the reconfiguration of interactions among people in
a heavily wired world. Some activities that are now conducted face-to-face
will happen through electronic mediation, once the capabilities of that
electronic mediation improve, and (less intuitively) some activities that are
now conducted through electronic mediation will happen face-to-face, now that
people are liberated to move wherever they want. If they don't have to sit
at a keyboard in front of a clunky terminal any more, they will probably want
to go someplace more interesting, such as getting together with the people
they want to interact with face-to-face. Think about these phenomena in the
community you are studying. What if the people had lots of portable computing
and high-quality interaction media? What if all their information was in
digital form, and what if they had suitcases to haul it all around with them?
Would they all disperse across the landscape, or would they all concentrate in
one place? How are their activities tied to particular places, and what sorts
of places would they (re)invent for themselves if their activities were less
tethered to anachronistic computers?
